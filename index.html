		<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
		<blockquote>Shasuna Lin is an aspiring programmer and digital designer who utilizes coding languages and tools like Blender and AutoCAD to create 3D renderings that combine surrealism and realism. Her work, inspired by the human body, touches on themes of self-imagery, womanhood, and motherhood, often featuring bold colors and grotesque nudity. Influenced by horror/sci-fi films, video games like Last of Us and Coraline, and childhood animations, she aims to integrate interactive elements into her art. Shasuna is also passionate about using her skills for creating user-friendly digital designs, infographics, and improving online experiences through both front-end and back-end development.
